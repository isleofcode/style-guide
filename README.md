Following is a somewhat complete document that outlines both style guides and a general approach to writing Javascript & Ember at Isle of Code.

For brevity, content is split across the following pages:

* [General JS Guidelines](general-and-javascript-style-guides.md);
* [Commit Style](commit-style-guides.md);
* [Branching Style](git-branch-style.md); and
* [Ember Specific Comments](ember-style-guides.md).
